## Getting started with Vite

**Vite** is a build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for web projects (Hot Module Replacement, Rollup, ...). **Vite** is quick in French (like "veet").

Quick start:

```sh
npm create vite@latest
npm i
npm run dev
```

Install and configure **ESLint**:

```sh
npm init @eslint/config
```
